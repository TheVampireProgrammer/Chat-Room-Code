This code has NO LISCENCE! But there are some rules:

 1. You are free to mod it.
 2. On line 61 and 63 of server.cs, YOU HAVE TO replace "placeholder" with any cuss word or word you don't want people using.
 3. Do not copy this code. I worked very hard on it.
 4. In user.cs, replace "0.0.0.0" on line 7 with the IP of your computer.
 5. RUN THE MAKEFILE AFTER ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! (use the command in the terminal "make" to do so.)
